Task 1 : Prediction using unsupervised learning 
       : data set https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view?usp=sharing
       
       About Task 1 : The data set involves total of 150 rows, which comprises of data for 50 flowers from each of the 3 species -  Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. Variables involved in the study are sepal length and width and petal length and width for each of the flowers, all the variable are measured in centimeters. Goal of the study is to perform exploratory analysis on the data and build a K-means clustering model to cluster them into groups. Here we have assumed we do not have the species column to form clusters and then used it to check our model performance.
